### About Our Project:

The goal of this project seems to be to create a laptop price analysis dashboard, which probably entails using a dataset that includes details on various laptop models, their costs, and their features. The analysis's goals are to shed light on laptop costs, the distribution of companies, and hardware details like RAM.

### Dataset Overview:
This section introduces the dataset used in the analysis. It includes an overview of its contents, such as laptop models, prices (in Euro), company names, and specifications (like RAM, storage, and laptop type).

First 5 Rows of the Dataset:
Objective: Display the first five rows of the dataset to give a glimpse into its structure and content. It helps to identify the main features (columns) that will be analyzed.
Dataset Information:

Objective: Summarizes metadata about the dataset, such as the number of entries (rows), column names, data types, and memory usage.

### Descriptive Statistics:
Objective: Provides summary statistics of the numerical features in the dataset (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values). This section is critical for understanding data distributions, outliers, and the range of values.

### Missing Values in the Dataset:
Objective: Identifies any missing or null values in the dataset, which is important for handling incomplete data and ensuring accurate analysis.

### Count of Laptops by Company (All):
Objective: Displays the total number of laptops from each company in the dataset. This helps analyze which companies dominate the laptop market.
Count of Laptops by Company (Even Occurrences)

Objective: This likely counts only the companies that have an even number of laptops in the dataset, perhaps for filtering purposes or comparison.

### Graph 1: Distribution of Laptop Prices in Euro:
Objective: A histogram or other chart that shows how laptop prices are distributed across different price ranges. This visualization highlights whether prices are clustered at certain ranges or spread evenly.

### Graph 2: Laptop Price vs. RAM (GB):
Objective: A scatter plot or line graph that visualizes the relationship between a laptop's price and its RAM size. This helps explore whether there is a correlation between higher RAM and higher price.

### Graph 3: Laptop Prices by Company:
Objective: A bar chart or boxplot that compares the prices of laptops from different companies. This can show price variation across brands and help identify premium vs. budget brands.

### Graph 4: Correlation Heatmap:
Objective: A heatmap that shows the correlation between various numerical features (such as price, RAM, storage size). It helps in understanding which features are related to one another and how strongly.

### Graph 5: Top 19 Laptop Products by Count:
Objective: A bar chart or similar graph that displays the top 19 laptop products based on their occurrence in the dataset. This could indicate which models are the most common or popular.

### Graph 6: Distribution of Laptop Types:
Objective: A pie chart or bar graph that shows the distribution of different laptop types (e.g., gaming, ultrabook, notebook). This helps in analyzing the variety of laptops present in the dataset.

### Graph 7: RAM Distribution by Laptop Type:
Objective: A graph that displays how RAM is distributed across different laptop types. For instance, it can show whether gaming laptops tend to have more RAM than notebooks.

### Graph 8: Count of Laptops by Type:
Objective: A graph that shows the number of laptops by type, providing insight into which laptop types are the most prevalent in the dataset.
